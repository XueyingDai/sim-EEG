# sim-EEG
This project simulates EEG signal by Kuramoto Model and Rossler Model. Different coupling strength, overlapping parameters, and network configurations of the models are used to assess the performance of the following measurements: (1) 1st order Partial Correlation, (2) 1st order Partial Cross Correlation, (3) Cross Correlation, and (4) Cross Correlation with adjustment (set to 0 if maxlag happens at zero lag time)
